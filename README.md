Android NetworkConnect Sample
===================================

This sample demonstrates how to connect to the network and fetch raw HTML using
HttpURLConnection. AsyncTask is used to perform the fetch on a background thread.

Introduction
------------

This sample application demonstrates how to connect to the network and fetch raw
HTML. It uses AsyncTask, a background task manager, to perform the network fetch
on a background thread. By using AsyncTask, the app can avoid hanging on the UI
thread, and instead update the UI when the response is ready. To establish the
network connection, the sample uses HttpURLConnection.
